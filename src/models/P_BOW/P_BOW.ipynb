      "\tIn the article \"Driverless Cars Are Coming\" the author displays many ways in witch these new additions to society can be a huge step forward in technology advances and also how they can cause problems. Google cofunder Sergey Brin believes in the driverless car and the safty of one. However, I strongly disagree with his outlook on the driverless car. In paragraph seven the author displays one issue that makes these type of cars problimatic. This issue is that the cars still need assistance when it comes to applying human reasoning and human skills that a robot cannot control. This is where my concern for the safety of the cars is tested. What would happen if the car did not recognize the situation as a human task? Would the car be able to react like a human being? To me, the answer is no, i believe that a robot cannot be taught to think and perform like a human being. In paragraph nine the law is the issue that is explained. In the article it states that that there is uncertainty between who would be responsible for injuries in an accident, the driver or the manufacturer? In my opionion this makes the cars even more of a threat. What if the manufacturer was to blame? Would individuals be more likely to get in an accident just for the money? Also presented in article nine is that in most of the states it is illegal to even test computer driven cars. Society does not trust the saftey of these cars so why should we. In conclusion, I feel Driverless cars are a hazard to society. Their saftey is the main concern. Nothing in this world can function or respond like a human being like we can, so how can we trust our safety in the hands of a computer?\n",

      "\tI believe that the so-called \"Face on Mars\" is actually just a rock formation that appears to be a face because of low-tech cameras from two decades ago. I'm going to explain why I believe that my claim is correct. First, it is clearly obvious that the face only appers as a face because of low resolution cameras and odd shadows, as you can see from the most recent photographs of the rock face. Even in the 1998 picture it is pretty clear that it is not in fact a face but is just a rock formation. The clouds obscure some of the face in the 1998 picture so it might not be conclusive, but the 2001 picture proves it. Also, if there were alien life of Mars, that would skyrocket NASA's budget to get to Mars because the public would be going crazy and the whole world would want to know. If there were alien life on Mars and NASA was the administration to discover it, the whole world's eyes and wallets would be on them, expecting them to put some men on mars to try to make contact with the Martian life forms, thus winning the race to put astronauts on Mars. In conclusion, I believe that the \"Face on Mars\" is just a rock formation and nothing more than that. There are clear reasons as to why NASA would want this to be alien life more than anyone, and reasons why they would not keep it a secret from the public.\n",

      "\tIn recent years, a debate around whether or not students should be required to take a class in the arts has arisen. On the one hand, it is understandable why the arts should be mandatory subjects in all schools — the arts provide enriching opportunities for creativity and personal expression, and can even be beneficial to enhance academic performance in other areas. On the other hand, every person has different capabilities and interests, and should be given the option to choose their own classes. It is important that the opportunity is given for students to find their own passions, and that is best encouraged by having the arts as electives. Classes in the arts should remain electives, as not all students have an aptitude in the arts, and forcing them to take these classes could lead to a negative experience. Electives allow students to find the subjects that are best-suited to their abilities and interests, while still having the opportunity to take courses in the arts if they so choose. Consider for instance, students who are far more motivated by sports or academics and would be much better served immersing in the areas where their strengths lie, than to force them to partake in an area where they have little to no enthusiasm or aptitude. Furthermore, allowing arts as electives leave more room for those who take a genuine interest in the arts to develop their skills and participate in enriching classes. Students who are truly passionate about the arts should be recognized and have the opportunity to grow their skills in a comfortable learning environment. Elective classes also provide more access to the arts and expand offerings for those who want to pursue it. Ultimately, classes in the arts should remain electives, as having the arts as electives allows students of varying capabilities and interests find their passions, and provides an enriching environment for those with genuine interests in the arts to pursue their skills. In this way, student's intellectual, creative and personal growth can be furthered and encouraged.\n",

I saw so many things that most people only get to read about in books. From exotic animals to breathtaking landscapes, it was all right there in front of me to explore. One of the reasons I decided to join the Seagoing Cowboys program was the opportunity to make a difference. By volunteering on farms and helping with agricultural work, I was able to learn new skills and contribute to the local community. It was a great way to give back and make a positive impact. And let me tell you, the sense of accomplishment I felt at the end of each day was unparalleled. Another reason I joined the program was for the adventure of it all. As a cowboy, I was no stranger to the outdoors, but experiencing it from the water was something else entirely. I got to try new activities, like sailing and fishing, and even learned how to surf! It was a great way to push myself outside of my comfort zone and try new things. Overall, my experience in the Seagoing Cowboys program was incredible. I got to travel to new places, meet new people, and try new things. It was an adventure I'll never forget and one that I encourage others to take. If you're looking for a way to make a difference and have the time of your life, then this is the program for you. So what are you waiting for? Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today!\n",

      "\tCar-free cities, the reduction of smog, and the end of car culture are all current trends that demonstrate the advantages of limiting car usage. In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars by Elisabeth Rosenthal, we learn that Vauban, a community in Germany, has implemented a car-free policy, resulting in a cleaner environment and improved quality of life for its residents. In Paris, due to smog, the government enforced a partial driving ban, leading to a 60% decrease in congestion (Ruffer, 2014). Similarly, Bogota, Colombia, has seen a significant decrease in smog and an increase in alternative transportation methods through its car-free day initiative (Selsky, 2002). These examples demonstrate that reducing car usage can lead to a cleaner and healthier environment. However, some may argue that limiting car usage is unrealistic or too expensive. Nevertheless, there are many benefits to reducing car usage, including cost savings, reduced traffic congestion, and improved air quality. According to the American Automobile Association, the average American driver spends over $1,000 per year on car expenses (AAA, n.d.). By reducing car usage, individuals can save money on fuel, maintenance, and parking. Additionally, reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to decreased traffic congestion and improved air quality, as seen in the examples provided earlier. Another argument against limiting car usage is that it may negatively impact the economy, particularly the automotive industry. However, as Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, pointed out at the Mobile World Congress, partnering with the telecommunications industry could create cities that are more connected and sustainable (Ford, 2013). This could lead to new job opportunities and economic growth in the alternative transport\n",

      "\tThere are some schools in the country that allow and are trying to enforce Distance learning. They say that it would benefit the students because they would be able to access their classes online but in reality it would only give us more stress. However there are some families who don't have the same benefits like everyone else. Won't be able to access the internet for the online classes and yes it may sound sad, but that is the reality we are living in. There was this classmate of mine, Generic_Name, we were given an assignment online and was due the very next day but he wasnt able to do it because he didn't have internet and so the teacher blamed it on him as if it really was his fault. Teachers are the ones wanting this because then they are just able to leave all the lesson plans online and say it due the very next day because we are able to do it at home. Kids come to school to learn, not to take everything at home and due it as if they have no life. Meanwhile, Some schools are giving kids options to go to class and or take them online. The schools like to think the best about everyone but there will be some kids using it as a way to not do anything. Last class there was a student named Generic_Name and he came to English class late so he had to do the work at home and the teacher put so much trust into him just for him to go out partying and not get anything done. It is better to do things in class and in the moment we are required to do so. By schools giving the options some may take it to advantage and some might put the work in to it but it really comes down to the students and many would say to do it in class. There are already so many distraction here in school like; your friends, phones and even people walking in the halls, but the same goes for at home. Here at school you have the teachers enforcing the rules and at home its just you, so you don't really worry about till the very last second. Students should stay in class and do their work rather than taking it home and doing it there where they would get distracted so easily. High school students have been known to have the exact stress levels as a person in an insane asylum and that is just from school work, but image if we started to bring school work home. When students enter their homes that is the time they are able to relax and release stress, not gain more. People dont really like to bring this subject up but by stacking stress onto stress is one of the main causes to suicides in high school. In high school we have take up to seven classes and that means seven the ties of stress, we take up all of our time in doing homework, sports and even work, why? because we have always been told that, you have to get a job to pay for college, you have to play a sport in high school to make friends. By doing homework, playing sports and working, no one has time to come home at like nine at night and have time to be with their families. The lack of family contact is another reasons of suicides and the thing stopping from getting the time and contact is school and extra homework. And giving us distance learning would only make things worse. Meanwhile, giving students the ability to do things from home would be great, but they would be lacking in human skills. By doing everything online at home sets a wall between the teacher and student. They wouldnt know life skills because you and to learn all of that in school by learning from your mistakes. Distance learning is the same as a child being home-schooled by their parents, they would only really know how to act with them and the moment they get sent out into the real world they don't know how to interact with anyone. We need human contact with each other in order to be sane. They need to learn how to trust someone and build relationships that would last a life time and they wouldn't be able to do that in their own homes. However, there are some benefits of distance learning. You are able to be out sick and not be behind in class because the teacher would just be able to send you the work. If you were to have any questions you would be able to send a message to your teacher. With the schools in the country trying to enforce distance learning may be focusing only on the benefits, and leaving the entire well being of their students. They are thinking about how it would impact them now and not in the long run. The stress levels would increase and so would the suicide rates.\n",

Well According to \"Teen Safety\" \"Over 3,287 deaths occur daily due to a car crash.\" Distracted driving whether it be from cell phone usage, eating, drinking, operating a radio, or even being lost in thought, it can lead to injuries or even death. When a vehicle is moving at the speed of 35 to 45 mph, Depending on the age of the drivers and passengers in both cars determines the fatality or how sever the injuries are in an accident. When drivers are trying to text and drive at the same time they are not thinking about how their actions can affect those around them. Drivers are not thinking about how they are putting someone else's life at risk or in danger when they are distracted driving from improper cell phone usage. Drivers are not considering that from the actions they are taking by using their cell phones that someone could lose their life or end up in the hospital with very severe injuries. Drivers who cannot wait to use their phone until the vehicle has come to a complete stop meaning that the vehicle is completely off are being really selfish and inconsiderable of those around them. So in conclusion drivers should not be able to use a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle because it is not safe for them or those around them and it can and will affect someone's life whether it's the driver who is using their cell phones to the people in the opposite car that they have had an accident with even down to the passengers in the same vehicle.\n",

This type of tecnonly would not be valuable to our schools. Although all of the facial recognition sounds good, there are some parts to it that could be bad. There are many things that could turn out to be negative. Here is a question to think about: Is he downgradeing teachers? In the sixth paragraph Dr. Huang of the Beackman Institute for Adveanced Science predicts, \"A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becomeing confused or bored\", he continues with, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" I believe he is trying to say that teachers don't do enough so we have to bring in a computer instructor to make it less boring. This is not only bad for the students, but also the teachers. This also can be a distraction in class. While the teacher is giving a lecture about an important skill that students need to learn, there are students in the back of the classroom trying to mess around with the facial coding system by trying different faces and causing a disruption. Kids are easily distracted and this is just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused on the studies that they will need for the rest of their life. While a child is learning, for instance, a math program site, they could be trying to get in it but there are ads that pop up ,in paragrah 6 it states that \"if you smile when a Web ad apperars on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" If a child looks away from the computer at his/her friend to wait for he ad to be over that he/she doesn't want, and smiles while glancing down to the screen to see if the ad is over, the computer could take this as a happy signal for the ad. So then it will play another one that is similar to the ad that the child did not want. So, no, I do not believe that this technology would be a very good tool to express in the classroom. I believe that there are lots of things that could go wrong, and not enough right. I don't think that this Coding System would be valuable to our schools.\n",

      "\tDriverless cars can be a great thing, but they can also be harm your safety and peoples safety. I believe that driverless cars are something that is made for the future and it should stay that way. I don't think that we need driverless cars because the regular cars we have are fine. Todays technology isn't that great to make driverless cars. It's ok to have a driverless car for long road trips because they could protect you more and react faster on a high way then on a everyday street that gets drove on everyday. I think the GM's idea on having the seat vibrate when backing up into a object is a great idea. Antilock breaks would be a horrible thing to put on a car because if your driving down a street and its raining real hard then out of no where your antilock breaks come on and you stop on a busy road that would be scary and its dangerous not just for you, but for everyone that would be involeved in that predicument. However, they explain how great driverless cars are and how they will help many people when it comes to driving, but anything could happen once you get behind the wheel and actually drive it and test it out. I don't think anyone would want a car that could steer for them that's more dangerous then having antilocks. In all, driverless cars are cars that should be made for the future. The world today doesn't need anything like that no time soon a regular motor car is doing perfectly fine. Driverless cars will be great for the future, but right now its not a good idea to make them the technology that we have today wouldn't be enough to make the car as accurate as the people who believes that the car would be perfect if they where made right now.\n",

      "\tDistance learning has become a popular option for students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. However, some argue that students may not benefit from this approach because they may be distracted by TV, video games, and cell phones. While some students may not attend school because it is too difficult, others may not benefit because they are too distracted at home. One of the main concerns with distance learning is that students may not have the same level of interaction with their peers as they would in a traditional classroom setting. This can lead to a lack of friendships and a feeling of isolation. Additionally, students may struggle with staying focused and motivated without the structure of a physical classroom. Another issue with distance learning is that students may not have access to the same resources as they would in a traditional classroom setting. For example, they may not have access to a library or specialized equipment. This can limit their ability to complete assignments and projects to the best of their ability. However, some argue that distance learning can be beneficial for students. For example, students may not have to wake up early or commute to school, which can be a major advantage for those who have other commitments. Additionally, students may have more flexibility in their schedules, which can allow them to better balance their academic and personal lives. Overall, the decision to offer distance learning as an option for students is a complex one. While it may have its advantages, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks and ensure that students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.\n",
