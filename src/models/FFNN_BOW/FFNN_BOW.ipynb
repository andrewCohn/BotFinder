With the driveless cars i think that you could. Accidents are one of the greatest problems in not only america but in whole world. You wont be able to bring back a loved one that passed away butity will be more preventable now. I think that driveless cars will be a great idea. People die every day due to mobile accidents. For example i have an uncle that past away because he was in an accident. The whole family was destroyed, it shook our lifes up. With the driveless cars i feel like accidents will reduce by alot. The drivelss cars will be very helpful. For example not every morning you wake up on time, if your running late you could do your make up in the car while your on way to work or wherever you need to be. Also if you need to take a call or you need to text someone, you wont have to worry about crashing and putting peoples lifes on risk because the car drives itself. Lastly, taking care of your kids, everyone has or has a baby in the car and know the struggle when they cry or get hungry, its not so pleasing but with the driveless car you would easly be able to assist them. Safety wouldnt be a big issue. You wouldnt have to care or be worried that your children are going to get run over because with the driveless care it was sensors for it to stop when its near an oblect or the seat will start buzzing for you to to stop. The driveless car would still be steerable incase soemthing goes wrong or it doesnt stop. Many things will be prevented with the driveless cars such as deaths and dangerous injuries. You could assist your children, do your needs, and most importantly theirnwill be more safety for everyone. Thats why i think that having driveless cares are a good idea.\n",

      "\tThe author makes a very valid point that caught me and kept me to his or her side. He or she stated that using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in a classroom could help improve the enviroment in the class. We've all had those lessons in school where we weren't quite getting it, or we had lost interest in the subject. The FACS could help us with this along with many other things that could turn valuable. The Facial Action Coding System works by using all of the 44 major muscles in the human face. It is programmed to understand how those muscles work and what it means when those muscles move. Meaning, if I were to smile, the system would recognize that I'm happy and could continue on with the lesson. If I were to frown and look angry, the system would know that I'm unhappy and could find another route for me to learn the lesson. With this technology, students don't have to worry about the lessons that they struggle with. This technology allows the computer to know their emotions and base their learning off of how they feel. If I don't understand a math problem on the computer and I have a confused look on my face, the computer analyzes my look and knows that I need more help. The computer knowing that allows me to get more help and understand the topic. FACS doesn't just have to be in a learning facility. It could be at your work, someday your home, and even used for security purposes. When we place FACS in some sort of work place, like an office. An office can get a little tense and stressful. With the knowledge in FACS, the computers used can realize that the user is under a lot of stress and might need a break. We could also use it for facial recognition in security cameras, laptops, desktops, even phones. And with the possibility of one day putting such technology in a home, it's crazy! Not only could you work on house work, but any other school work with FACS! The possibilities are pretty endless with FACS. The ideas go on and on with this type of technology, and I fully support this author and what he or she is trying to do.\n",

      "\tDear State Senator, Keeping the electoral eollege method shouldn't be appropriate for electing the next president. In source two it says that when you use the electoral college system and you vote,not only do you vote not only for one person but other people pledged to that person. Now,I don't think it's the best idea to choose this method despite it being a more simple process but using the popular vote method sounds more fair,source two also says that someone won the popular vote but the electoral college prevented him from becoming the next president. The electoral college causes too much confusion,its unfair and it's caused more problems with voting. Although,using the elctoral college method is more simple,it can cause a lot of confusion. If you vote for one person then you automatically vote for the other people pledged to that person. Many people who have ran for persident have lost due to the electoral college method but they've won the popular vote. Its possible that when you are voting you don't know who else you're voting for. To continue with,the electoral college method can be unfair because of the people who lost due to the system. Some people that ran for president won the popular vote but lost the electoral college vote. Others also lost because of the \"winner-take-all\" system,it awards every elector to the winning presidential candidate. This method has caused problems with voting because of it being unfair. Some of the problems its caused was how others win automatically if the president they pledged to won the electoral college vote. This method of voting has to go. In conclusion,the electoral college voting system shouldn't be used again in the future becasue of its confusion. It can have you voting for someone pledged to the preisdent that you didn't wan to vote for. It can also be unfair. Many people lost because of this method but won the popular vote. Last it's caused too much problems as a voting system in general.\n",

      "\tI do not have personal opinions or beliefs. however, i can provide a sample argumentative essay to help you understand how to approach the prompt. driverless cars: a dangerous experiment the development of driverless cars is a controversial issue that has sparked heated debates across the globe. while some people see it as a technological breakthrough that will revolutionize transportation, others view it as a dangerous experiment that could lead to disastrous consequences. after reading the article \"driverless cars are coming,\" i firmly believe that we should halt the development of these cars to avoid putting human lives at risk. to begin with, one of the most significant concerns regarding driverless cars is their safety. according to the article, these vehicles rely on sophisticated software and sensors to navigate the roads, and any malfunction could lead to severe accidents. for example, in 2018, a self-driving uber car hit and killed a pedestrian in arizona, highlighting the dangers of this technology. additionally, hackers could exploit the software vulnerabilities of driverless cars, causing them to crash or be used as weapons. these safety risks are simply too high to ignore. moreover, driverless cars could lead to massive job losses in the transportation sector, such as taxi and truck drivers. the article mentions that these vehicles could reduce the need for human drivers, potentially leaving millions of people unemployed. this would have a devastating impact on the economy and the livelihoods of many families. lastly, the cost of developing and implementing driverless cars is astronomical, and taxpayers would likely bear the brunt of these expenses. the article notes that companies such as google and uber have spent billions of dollars on this technology, and governments would need to invest heavily in infrastructure to support these vehicles. this money could be better spent on improving public transportation or addressing other critical societal issues. in conclusion, driverless cars are a dangerous experiment that could have severe consequences for human safety, employment, and the economy. while some may argue that this technology could lead to fewer accidents and reduced traffic, the risks far outweigh any potential benefits. we should focus our resources on improving existing transportation systems rather than gambling on an untested and potentially deadly innovation.\n",

      "\tPROPER_NAME PROPER_NAME Period:7 DAY_MONTH_YEAR In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around. You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk. It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles. If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution. It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to \"give up\" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house. In Vauban,Germany, this \"smart planning\" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer. 70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations. The town is not completely \"car free,\" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg. Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way. Smog is a big problem in Paris,France. After several days of \"near-record pollution,\" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air. About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine. The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog. The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France. The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted.\n",

      "\tTaking responsibility for oneself is an essential aspect of life that can have a significant impact on our future. As we grow older, we are expected to take charge of our lives and make decisions that will affect our future. It is important to understand that taking responsibility for our actions is not always easy, but it is necessary to achieve success and fulfillment in life. One of the first steps in taking responsibility for oneself is to acknowledge our mistakes and learn from them. It is easy to blame others or circumstances when things do not go as planned, but it is important to take responsibility for our actions and learn from them. For example, if we fail an exam, we should not blame the teacher or the test, but rather take responsibility for our own studying habits and identify areas where we need to improve. Another important aspect of taking responsibility for oneself is to set goals and work towards achieving them. It is important to have a clear vision of what we want to achieve in life and to take the necessary steps to make it happen. For example, if we want to become a successful entrepreneur, we should start by researching the industry, creating a business plan, and taking the necessary steps to start our own business. Taking responsibility for oneself also involves making difficult decisions and accepting the consequences of those decisions. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of our actions and make informed decisions that will lead to the best outcome. For example, if we are faced with a difficult decision at work, we should consider the potential consequences of our actions and make a decision that will lead to the best outcome for both ourselves and the company. In conclusion, taking responsibility for oneself is an essential aspect of life that can have a significant impact on our future. It is important to acknowledge our mistakes, set goals, and make difficult decisions in order to achieve success and fulfillment in life. By taking responsibility for our actions, we can learn from our mistakes, achieve our goals, and lead a fulfilling life.\n",

      "\tHave you ever been forced to do something you might not always want to by a parent or a teacher, such as an after school activity? Many students are pressured to sign up for sports, clubs, or other extracurricular activities by parents, friends, and teachers. This ensures that they are getting physical activity, time off electronics, and are spending time with their community. However, students should not be forced to participate in these extracurricular activities because of their homework and jobs, lack of time spent with their families and friends, and the money some families do not have to pay for these activities. Students' lives are almost always busy, and many rarely have a chance to relax. First, they have to spend eight hours of their day in school, only to go home and do two hours of homework. After that homework, many students go work jobs to save for college or build a resume. Even after that job has ended, students go home and may have to help do chores around the house. Only after those fourteen hours of the day have flown by is the student allowed to finally get ready for bed, struggle to get their required eight hours of sleep, and wake up only to do it all again. With this crowded schedule, it would be near impossible to manage an after school activity that lasts about two hours on top of all that. Kids should be able to enjoy their childhood by hanging out with their friends and relaxing, not having to worry about how the yearbook is coming along, if the sports teams are doing well this season, and if the school has the budget for prom at the end of the year. Those are enrichment activities that people without as busy lives should be able to choose to partake in, not forced to. People hear a lot that they should strive to spend quality time with their friends and family, to ensure they don't become a little hermit that lives in a secluded world of their own. On top of the already insane schedule many students maintain, there's very little time left for spending time with friends and loved ones. Many students miss out on going to the mall on weekends with their friends, going out on dates with their significant other, and laughing at movies with their parents and siblings because they're busy working, applying to colleges, or doing homework that a teacher assigned to them over the weekend. Forcing them to participate in extracurricular activities does not benefit the situation at all. On top of not being able to spend time with the people that mean most to them, they're being told to run laps at sports practices, waking up at dawn to get ready for the big game, taking pictures for the yearbook at events, or going to meetings with the other student government members to plan the school dance. This causes immense stress for students, and it also weakens the bonds and strains the relationships between students and their friends and family. It's not exactly difficult to see the fact that many students' families struggle financially. Many times, the only time students ever get to eat is at school, and often don't have enough money for hygiene, clothes, or school supplies. If these students are forced to participate in these after school activities, they may not be able to afford it; if they can, it often becomes even more of a struggle for the family, as that money could have been spent on paying the bills or food, rather than it being spent on sports uniforms and gas for cars that need to be driven to and back from practices, meetings, and events. Sports tend to be very expensive, with registration fees, uniforms, proper equipment, gas to drive the students places, and snacks to provide after school, as many students need to eat during practices. ninety percent of Americans are already in some sort of debt, whether it's student loans, house mortgage, cars, or just bad spending. Adding the cost of sports or other after school activities will drown students and their families in bills that they may not be able to pay off. Although it is a good idea for students to participate in extracurricular activities, they should never be forced to because it impacts many students negatively because of their busy schedules, lack of time with their friends and loved ones, and because of the financial struggles many students' families face and may not be able to afford. Instead, students should be able to say whether they can and want to participate in these activities, or be able to not do extracurricular activities and be able to relax and spend their leisure time however they please.\n",

      "\tEmotional expressions Did you know that emotional expression are easily to see. Using technology to see emotional expression, you can see it in video imagery. this can track some facial movements in a real face or in a painted face. or humans can perform some facial expressions. Humans can probably see when a person is doing a facial expression by how they feel. Like for example if they are sad, happy, or worried, you can easily see it by their expressions. In computers if you take a picture and put on the computer and you are smiling the computer would see what kind of emotions you will have. Also in some computer can animate some faces expression like for example when a character from a movie is having a painful feeling you can animated and put the emotion that the character is feeling. Like for example the character's emotin is sadness, happy, worried, angry, etc. You can also show some facial expression by moving your muscles like for example, eyebrows, mouth, nose, etc. You can make expression by just moving some muscles in your face. In conclusion you can make some facial expression using some techonology to make or see facial expressions, or seeing in painting the expression that they have. Or you can do some expression by moving your muscles in your face like eyebrows, nose, and mouth.\n",

      "\tI believe that the idea of having only three years of high school can be quite stressful for some students, especially those who are taking courses in the evenings or summer school while also having to work or take care of responsibilities at home. While it may seem like a good idea to finish high school early, I believe that the benefits of having four years of high school outweigh the potential stress. While it is true that students who complete high school in three years may be able to graduate early and potentially attend college or a program like NOVA, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of this option. For example, students who choose to complete high school in three years may have to take on more courses in a shorter amount of time, which could lead to a higher level of stress and potentially lower grades. Additionally, students who are not fully prepared for the level of responsibility and workload that comes with taking on more courses in a shorter amount of time may struggle to keep up with their studies and achieve their goals. On the other hand, students who choose to complete high school in four years may have more time to focus on their studies and potentially take on extracurricular activities or internships. This could give them a better chance at getting into their desired college or program, as well as provide them with valuable experience and skills that they can use in the future. Additionally, students who have more time to prepare for the transition to college or the workforce may be better equipped to handle the challenges that come with these new environments. In conclusion, while the idea of having only three years of high school may seem appealing, I believe that the benefits of having four years of high school outweigh the potential stress. Students who choose to complete high school in four years may have more time to focus on their studies, potentially take on extracurricular activities or internships, and be better prepared for the transition to college or the workforce. While there may be some drawbacks to completing high school in three years, I believe that the benefits of having four years of high school make it a better choice for most students.\n",

      "\tSchools assign summer projects to students with the aim of preventing summer learning loss and keeping students academically engaged during their time off. However, not all summer work is equally effective or fair. Instead of mandatory projects designed by teachers, I believe students should have the flexibility to design their own summer learning experiences. When teachers alone design summer curriculum, it risks feeling like a chore imposed on students against their will. Students may complete the work with little intrinsic motivation or engagement, just to satisfy the requirement. This reduces the potential for meaningful learning to take place. In contrast, allowing students autonomy in selecting their own summer projects taps into their natural curiosity. When students pursue self-directed learning in areas they find genuinely interesting, they are more likely to delve deeply into subjects and retain what they learn. Student-designed projects also recognize that students have diverse interests, strengths, and preferred learning styles. One size does not fit all when it comes to summer enrichment. Some students may thrive conducting hands-on experiments, while others prefer reading-based assignments. By letting students tailor projects to their own preferences, every student's unique talents and passions can be engaged over the summer months. This fosters enjoyment of learning, which is important for long-term development. Of course, fully open-ended summer work requires guidance. Teachers should provide parameters like minimum time commitments or standards for project types. Students could also submit proposals for teacher approval before beginning individualized work. This ensures students do not get overwhelmed with choices or select activities that fail to meet educational objectives. With support and structure, student-designed summer learning can help maintain academic growth while still feeling meaningful and motivating for each learner. In conclusion, if the goal of summer schoolwork is to foster continued learning and engagement during time off, students themselves should have agency in selecting project topics. This taps into students' natural enthusiasm and recognizes their diverse interests, leading to richer and more sustained educational experiences over the summer months. As long as teachers provide suitable guidance and parameters, student-designed projects can help summer learning feel inspired rather than imposed.\n",
